# Nike Landing Page 

This project is a responsive Nike landing page built using **`` React ``** and **`` Tailwind CSS ``**, and deployed with **`` Vercel ``**. 
It features a sleek, modern design for a brand-focused website, showcasing various product categories, services, and customer reviews while providing a clean and engaging user experience. 
The site is static and purely design-focused, meaning there are no functional buttons or links.
Its purpose is to demonstrate how to use Tailwind CSS with React to create a visually appealing interface.
